Ingredients (Makes about 24 cookies):
1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
1 cup (220g) brown sugar, packed
5 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
Optional: 1 cup (120g) chopped nuts (e.g., walnuts or pecans)
Instructions:
Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
Mix the Wet Ingredients:

In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy.
Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
Prepare the Dry Ingredients:

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
Combine Wet and Dry:

Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until well combined.
Add the Chocolate Chips:

Fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using) until evenly distributed.
Scoop and Shape:

Use a tablespoon or cookie scoop to drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
Bake:

Bake in the preheated oven for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers look set.
Do not overbake; the cookies will continue to cook slightly as they cool.
Cool:

Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
Tips:
For softer cookies, underbake slightly and let them cool on the baking sheet.
For crispier cookies, bake until the edges are deeply golden brown.
Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freeze for longer storage.
